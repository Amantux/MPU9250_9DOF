# MPU9250_9DOF
9DOF system for MPU9250/6500


I purchased a MPU9250/6500 on amazon and I couldn't find how to integrade values to create a 3 Axis System. It took 14 libries (until I found 2 that did the trick),some forced mapping, and a lot of coffee until I made this.

I will slowly update it, as currently it only operates at 512 samples/sec

Needs 
"MadgwickAHRS" And "MPU9250" to function, will be including my edited versions in later releases
